In this report, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was implemented for handwritten 
digit classification using the MNIST dataset. The model achieved high accuracy through the 
use of multiple convolutional layers, pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. The 
performance of the CNN was demonstrated to be superior to earlier machine learning 
methods, such as k-NN and SVM, which relied on manually extracted features.

A variation of regularization techniques, including data augmentation, dropout, and early 
stopping, was applied to improve the model's generalization ability and prevent 
overfitting. These techniques have been shown to enhance CNN performance on similar image 
classification tasks. The results of this study confirm the effectiveness of CNNs for image 
classification and highlight the importance of regularization methods in achieving optimal 
performance. Future work could involve exploring more advanced CNN architectures or 
applying the model to other image datasets to further assess its robustness and scalability.
